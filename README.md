# Distributed k-select using MPI

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the distributed k-select (quickselect) algorithm using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel computing.
The algorithm is designed to find the kth smallest element in a supposed large array that exceeds the memory capacity of a single computer.
